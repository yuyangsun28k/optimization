    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical optimization, simplex method is a popular linear programming algorithm that can solve many linear optimization problems. Optimization problems aim to select the best element regarding certain criterias among all possible elements. To select the best element, simplex method introduces slack variables, tableaus, and pivot variables to find the optimal solution for an optimization problem. The simplex technique can be solved with python codes and this artifact will explain how a standard simplex method work in solving problems with an example illustrated.\n",

    "### Procedure of Simplex Method\n",
    "Consider the linear optimization problem: maximize $\\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{x}$ subject to $A \\mathbf{x} \\leq \\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$. Right here we have an objective function of maximizing $\\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{x}$, the decision variable $\\mathbf{x}$ and constraints  $A \\mathbf{x} \\leq \\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$. To perform simplex method, we need to rewrite the function and make it into a standard form and then:\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of using matrix form to solve could save lots of time when we increase number of constraints and variables. In reality, some of the problems are much more complicated than that and might require multiple pivot-shiftings. The method produces an optimal solution to satisfy the given constraints and produce a maximum objective when all the coefficients on the decision variables are non-negative. To use the simplex method, the model should be linearr and in standard form, where we introduce slack variables then. To proceed, we use the tableau and pivot to check optimality until an optimal solution is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes special case like degeneracy will happen to affect the results and we can apply bland's rule to prevent it. Degeneracy will waste time for calculation or it will become a cycle in worse cases. In general, it is not efficient for the simplex method model but might be occur in various real-world cases. Now we have a method to deal with the degeneracy, which makes simplex method a very strong linear programming algorithm."
