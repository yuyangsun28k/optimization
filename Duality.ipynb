    "In mathematics, if there exists a standard primal form with an objective function, constraints and decision variables, then we can have a dual form based on the information of primal form. The dual form has an inverse objective from the original primal with each variable in the primal becomes a constraint in the dual, and each constraint in the primal becomes a variable in the dual. Below is the basic structures of a primal-dual pair.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "The above three advantages of duality can be applied to many linear programming problems, especially when primal problems encounter infeasibility or there are less variable numbers but multiple constraints. The duality brings efficiency and convinences when we are working on those linear programming problems. There are also many advantages of duality in transportation optimization, matrix game and network problems as well. Although duality is not always the first-choice method for solving linear programming problems, its functionality is still board in these fields."
